OOP Design approach

1. Write a textual description of the problem or exercise
2. Extract the significant nouns and verbs from the description
3. Organize and associate the verbs and nouns

Description

1. Tic Tac Toe is a 2 player board game
2. The board is a 3x3 grid
3. Players take turns marking a square with a marker than that identifies the player
4. The first player to mark 3 squares in a row wins
5. Traditionally, the player to go first uses the marker X to mark their squares, and the player to go second uses O as a marker.
6. The first player to mark 3 squares in a row with their marker wins the game
7. A row can be horizontal, vertical, or either of the two diaganols 
8. There is one human player and one computer player
9. The human player always moves first in the initial version of our game

Nouns: game, board, square, grid, marker, row, player, human, computer
Verbs: play, mark, move, place

Organize most likely relationships:

Game
Board
Row
Square
Marker
Player
    Mark
    Play
    Human
    Computer

    
Now create scaffolding
