Step-by-Step Guide: Allowing `codespace` User to Execute `psql` as `postgres`

1. Access the Terminal in GitHub Codespaces:
    - Open your GitHub repository.
    - Launch the GitHub Codespace for the repository.
    - Open the terminal within the Codespace.

2. Edit the `sudoers` File:
    - To change the permissions, use `visudo` to safely edit the `sudoers` file:
      sudo visudo
      This ensures you don't accidentally lock yourself out with incorrect syntax.

3. Modify the `sudoers` File to Allow `codespace` User to Run `psql` as `postgres`:
    - In the `sudoers` file, locate the section where user permissions are defined.
    - Add the following line to allow the `codespace` user to run `/usr/bin/psql` as the `postgres` user without a password prompt:
      codespace ALL=(postgres) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/psql

4. Save and Exit the `sudoers` File:
    - After adding the line, save and exit the `visudo` editor:
        - In `visudo`, press Ctrl+X to exit.
        - If prompted to save changes, press Y (Yes), and then hit Enter.

5. Test the Changes:
    - Try running the command to access `psql` as `postgres`:
      sudo -u postgres psql
    - You should no longer be prompted for a password. The `codespace` user should now have permission to run `psql` as `postgres`.

Important Notes:
    - Security Considerations: Allowing a user to run `psql` as `postgres` without a password could expose your environment to risks. Ensure that such access is only granted when necessary.
    - Rebuilding Codespaces: If you face further issues, you can try rebuilding the Codespace to reset configurations.
