# Pseudocode

Before we can take our pseudocode and translate it to program code, we must formalize the pseudocode a little more. We'll still use English, but we'll use some keywords to help us break down the program logic into concrete commands, which makes translating to code more natural.

We'll use the below keywords to assist us, along with their meaning.

Keyword	Meaning
START	start of the program
SET	set a variable that we can use for later
GET	retrieve input from user
PRINT	display output to user
READ	retrieve a value from a variable
IF/ELSE IF/ELSE	show conditional branches in logic
WHILE	show looping logic
END	end of the program

# Flowchart Components

Used to determine logic flow in a program

-![alt text](image.png)
- oval: start/stop
- rectangle: processing step - define variables here
- rhombus: input/output 
- Diamond: decision, only has two branches
    - If decision w/ > 3 branches, user seperate diamonds
- Circle: connector


# Pylint

- C: (Convention) for programming standard       violation
- R: (Refactor) for bad code smell
- W: (Warning) for Python specific problems
- E: (Error) for semantic errors that cause broken code
- F: (Fatal) for errors which prevented further processing

- Use a .pylintrc file for configurations to modify how strict it is on grading. Create this in your project directory

# Refactoring calcualtor program

- Use helper functions to wrap up repetetive code
- Use try and except statement and a while loop to evaluate if 
something is true to validate waht the user inputs

# Precedance rules - top to bottom

Operators	Meaning
()	Parentheses
**	Exponent
+x, -x, ~x	Unary plus, Unary minus, Bitwise NOT
*, /, //, %	Multiplication, Division, Floor division, Modulus
+, -	Addition, Subtraction
<<, >>	Bitwise shift operators
&	Bitwise AND
^	Bitwise XOR
|	Bitwise OR
==, !=, >, >=, <, <=, is, is not, in, not in	Comparisons, Identity, Membership operators
not	Logical NOT
and	Logical AND
or	Logical OR

- and and or do not have precedence, in an expression it goes left to right
- For short circuting, or statements return the first truthy element or they return the last falsy element
- the and statement returns teh last truthy element and the first falsy one
- python will print the last element in an expression to the terminal
- remember [none] is actually 

# Dict view objects

- the .keys() method returns a dictionary view object and not an actual list. If you print it it will print with ([]) which shows its not an actual list
- dict view objects are dynamic, so changes to the dict will show in all of them

## Naming Conventions
Naming conventions: legal vs. idiomatic, illegal vs. non-idiomatic
- Closely related to the stylistic conventions discussed in the Using Python chapter are the Python naming conventions. Names that follow these conventions are idiomatic. In contrast, those that do not are non-idiomatic (valid but not idiomatic) or illegal (your code will either raise a syntax error or do something unexpected).

- Naming conventions for most identifiers (excluding constant and class names):

    Use snake_case formatting for these names.
    Names may contain lowercase letters (a-z), digits (0-9), and underscores (_).
    Names should begin with a letter.
    If the name has multiple words, separate the words with a single underscore (_).
    Names that begin or end with one or two underscores have special meaning under the naming conventions. Don't use them until you understand how they are used.
    Names may only use letters and digits from the standard ASCII character set.
- Idiomatic Names:
    foo
    answer_to_ultimate_question
    eighty_seven
    index_2
    index2
- Constant names (unchanging named values):

    Use SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE formatting for these names.
    Names may contain uppercase letters (A-Z), digits (0-9), and underscores (_).
    Names should begin with a letter.
    If the name has multiple words, separate the words with a single underscore (_).
    Names that begin or end with one or two underscores have special meaning under the naming conventions. Don't use them until you understand how they are used.
    Names may only use letters and digits from the standard ASCII character set.
- Idiomatic Names:
    FOO
    ANSWER_TO_ULTIMATE_QUESTION
    EIGHTY_SEVEN
    INDEX_2
    INDEX2

- Class names:

    Use PascalCase formatting for these names. PascalCase is sometimes called CamelCase (with both Cs capitalized).
    Names may contain uppercase and lowercase letters (A-Z, a-z) and digits (0-9).
    Names should begin with an uppercase letter.
    If the name has multiple words, capitalize each word.

- Idiomatic Names
    Foo
    UltimateQuestion
    FourLeggedPets
    PythonVersion2Rules

- Note that many non-idiomatic names are still legal (valid) Python identifiers. Sometimes, it makes sense to break the rules. However, not all identifiers are legal; here are some things you must do:

    You can use letters, digits, and underscores in Python identifiers. Extended ASCII and Unicode letters and digits are allowed.
    You may not use punctuation characters, most special characters, or whitespace.
    You may not start identifiers with a digit.
    You may not use Python's reserved words such as if, def, while, return, and pass as names.

- Non-Idiomatic Names	Explanation
    fourWayIntersection:	camelCase
    SchÃ¶n:	Extended ASCII

    Illegal Names	Explanation
    pass:	        Reserved word
    3xy:	        Starts with digit
    ultimate-question:	Hyphen
    one two three:	Whitespace
    is_lowercase?:	Punctuation
    is+lowercase:	Special character

- Most illegal names will raise an error. However, if the illegal name looks like valid Python, you won't get an error.

- Variable names are often referred to by the broader term identifiers. In Python, identifiers refer to several things:
    - Variable and constant names
    - Function and method names
    - Function and method parameter names
    - Class and module names
