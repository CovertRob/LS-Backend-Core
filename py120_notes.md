# Object Oriented Programming Notes

## States and Behaviors

- Instance varialbes keep track of state
- Instance methods expose behavior for objects

## Object Scope

- Object scope refers to the methods and instance variables an object can access
  - Methods - includes those acquired by the class via inheritance or minx-ins
  - Instance varialbles - includes variables acquired via inheritance
- The instance methods to NOT belong to the object, they belong to the Class (the object can access them)
- Instance variables belong to the objects
  - An object can only access its own state

## Object Instantiation

- **For Launch School, instantiating a new class is considered it's constructor and the `__init__` method inside the class is the initializer (instance constructor) *** - remember bc different naming convention than what I am used to with Java

## Instance Variables
