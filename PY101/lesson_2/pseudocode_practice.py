# Write a function that returns the sum of two numbers
# INFORMAL
# First greet the user at program execution

# Prompt the user for number 1
# Prompt the user for number 2

# Add number 1 and number 2
# Print the sum to the terminal #

# START 

# PRINT Welcome to the sum program

# PRINT Please enter number 1:
# GET number 1 input 

# PRINT Please enter number 2:
# GET number 2 input 

# READ number 1 and number 2 and PRINT the sum

# Write a function that takes a list of strings and returns a string
# that is all those strings concatenated together

#START 
# Given an input list of strings from the user or program

# Define the function here with a list parameter

    # cocatenate list of strings to empty sting using join method
    # and return the concatenated string

#----------------------------------------------------------#

# Write a function that takes a list of integers, and returns a new list
# with every other element from the original list, starting with the 
# first element

# Given an input list of itegers from the user or program

# Define function instance here with a list parameter
    # utilize list comprehension with index method to iterate and
    # return every other number in list

#----------------------------------------------------#

# Write a function that determines the index of the 3rd occurrence of 
# a given character in a string. For instance, if the given 
# character is 'x' and the string is 'axbxcdxex', the function 
# should return 6 (the index of the 3rd 'x'). 
# If the given character does not occur at least 3 times, return None.

# Given string input from user or program

# Define function instance with string parameter
    # SET counter for number of instances = 0
    # Define for loop for length of string
        # If character at indice = function argument increment counter
        # If instance counter == 2 return the current indice 
    # return none as default return

#---------------------------------------------------------#

# Write a function that takes two list of numbers and returns the result of 
# merging the lists. The elements of the first list should become the
# elements at the even indexes of the returned list, while the 
# elements of the second list should become the elements at the odd
# indexes

# Given two lists of numbers from the user or program

# Define function with two list parameters
    # Create empty list that will be the list we return
    # Comment: asume both lists have the same number of elements
    # SET list 1 counter = 0
    # SET list 2 counter = 0
    # While counter 1 and counter 2 less than list size
        # append list 1 to new list
        # append list 2 to new list
    # return concatenated list
